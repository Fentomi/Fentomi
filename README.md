# Hello there! :wave: A little bit about me.. :cat2:
My name is **Nikita** and I'm a **21 year old beginner programmer** :computer: and **student** :mortar_board: . For a long time I didn't keep my github account because I was *embarrassed*  to upload my developments here. I will definitely overcome this threshold.
## :closed_book: I have studied technologies such as
- *Python*
- *C# (+Unity)*
- *HTML/CSS/JS*
- *Databases (SQL, Oracle)*
## :memo: I'm studying at the moment
I'm learning python frameworks, then I want to learn JavaScript.
## :envelope: If you want to contact me
