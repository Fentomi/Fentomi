# Hello there! A little bit about me..
My name is **Nikita** and I'm a **21 year old beginner programmer** and **student**. For a long time I didn't keep my github account because I was embarrassed to upload my developments here. I will definitely overcome this threshold.
## I have studied technologies such as
- *Python*
- *C# (+Unity)*
- *HTML/CSS*
- *Databases (SQL, Oracle)*
## I'm studying at the moment
I'm learning python frameworks, then I want to learn JavaScript.
## :envelope: If you want to contact me
